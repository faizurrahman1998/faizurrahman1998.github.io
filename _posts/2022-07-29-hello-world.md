I have always wanted a personal blog site of my own. But too lazy to learn HTML & CSS. 
So, here I am with the saviour Jekyll. 

I still don't know what am I going to write about here. But Python & CPP will be there
for sure.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

```cpp

#include <iostream>

auto constexpr newline = "\n"; 

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << newline;
}
```
